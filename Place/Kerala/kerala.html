        <div class="hat"><p><br><br>The state of Kerala is a secluded haven for the tourists that are seeking a retreat from the humdrum and hustle bustle of a day-to-day life. The health-giving sea breezes of Arabian Sea forms the western boundary of the city. The mountain ranges of Western Ghats set its eastern boundary. This narrow strip of land is also known as a “God’s own country.” As a tourist, it can become an ideal destination for you because it offers a natural variety. For instance, you can find a hill station in Wayanad then you can stay on houseboat inside the backwaters of Kerala and finally you can retire on a beach to complete the circle. Tourist places in Kerala will give you an experience that will be etched in your memory forever.</p></div>
