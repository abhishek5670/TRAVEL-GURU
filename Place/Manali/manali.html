        <div class="hat"><p><br><br>Nestled in the mighty Himalayas, Manali has an abundance of spectacular valleys filled with forests of oak, fir, deodar and pine. It is a full package of nature, food, adventure sports and ancient heritages. Splashing river Beas flows proudly amidst the valley. A lot of gushing waterfalls like Jogni falls and Rahala fall flush out of haphazardly placed rocks. You can also catch sights of sprawling meadows, terraced farming and fruit orchards. All these sights adds up to making the town look breathtakingly beautiful.<br>
            Manali is no less than a box full of an array of sweets. You can dig in it and collect as many gems as you want. And by gems, it means ‘memories’. Wait no longer and pack all that you need for a fun-filled trip. Grab your laptop to book your tickets and head off to this lovely place to have some experiences to cherish throughout your life.</p></div>    </body>
