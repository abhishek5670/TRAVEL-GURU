        <div class="hat"><p><br><br> The chaotic, colourful streets of Jaipur present a recurrent pattern of new and old. The city, encircled by besieged walls and rugged hills, is full of well-preserved historical buildings and royal heritage. It forms a part of the Golden Triangle Tourist Circuit, with its wide roads dotted with majestic statues and its impressive palaces.<br>

            The City Palace is an iconic landmark that lies at the heart of the city, still housing the royal family. The Jantar Mantar is another famous attraction, with its vast collection of ancient astronomical instruments. While here, prepare to get bedazzled by the architectural brilliance of the Hawa Mahal and the grandeur of Jaipurâ€™s star attraction, the Amber Fort.<br>
            
            On the outskirts of Jaipur lies the Aravalli hills, which presents ample trekking opportunities at Chouri Ghat and Bhuteshwar Nath. You can also take part in cycling tours and check out some of the seasonal waterfalls around here. Nahargarh and Jhalana provide wildlife photography and jungle safari opportunities. ATV rides and zip-lining are some of the other activities you can try out in Jaipur.<br>
            
            Jaipur has a hot semi-arid climate with hot summers and mild winters that are short lived. The monsoon season runs from July to August, providing yearly precipitation of more than 63 cm. The average temperature here lies around 25.1 degrees Celsius and on rare occasions, it can fall below freezing point in winter.</p></div>
