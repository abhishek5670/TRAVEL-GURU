        <div class="hat"><p><br><br>You can see the Gateway of India, Marine drive or the film city of Goregaon, or visit the Siddhivinayak temple and Haji Ali Mosque for your fill of the spiritual. You can even get to see the new addition to the roster of mesmerizing and intimidating places in Mumbai, the Bandra Worli Sealink. And be it a group hangout, a solo search of solace or just a couple's getaway, Chowpatty, Juhu, and Aksa Beach are names that almost everyone in the city knows and crowds on various occasions. They are equally coveted by the many who come to Mumbai from outside for the frolicking and snacking experiences that are available at these locations. One more thing that Mumbai is famous for is the shopping district at Colaba, where you can get everything from high brand store clothes to cheap knock-offs to add to your wardrobe as part of your fashion statement.</p></div>
